Prerequisites
=============

Beebop depends on the following libraries:

  * GTK+
  * Cairo (with PDF support)
  * Pango (with Cairo support)
  * libxml2
  * librsvg

If any of these libraries is missing or outdated, the configure
script should warn you.


Installation
============

After running configure, use make to compile the program and make install
to install it.

Depending on the selected installation path (see configure --help for more
information about that) you might need to run the last command as root.
