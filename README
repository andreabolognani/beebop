Beebop -- Easily create nice-looking shipping lists
===================================================

Beebop is a software that helps you create shipping lists.

You fill in all the needed data, hit Save and get a shiny PDF with
your shipping list, complete with your custom logo, ready to print.

Beebop also keeps a copy of the shipping list in a simple XML-based
format, so that you can later open the list for editing.

The program offers a pretty good degree of configurability, so you
can make your shipping lists look just the way you like them.
