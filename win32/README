Beebop for win32
================

Beebop works fine on win32: you can compile it from GNU/Linux using mingw32,
and create an installer using NSIS under wine.


Cross-compilation
-----------------

The cross-configure script is a small wrapper around configure. Use

	path/to/cross-configure --installdir PATH

from any directory, then run make and make install as usual. You will
end up with a win32 executable and a bunch of data files in PATH.


Installer creation
------------------

This step is not automated by the build system, but it's trivial to
perform: after you have run the above commands, copy the beebop.nsi and
beebop.ico files from the win32/ directory (if you have used a separate
build directory, you'll find beebop.nsi in the win32/ subdirectory of
your build directory) to PATH, cd to PATH and run

	wine path/to/makensis.exe beebop.nsi

to obtain a shiny win32 installer.


Deployment
----------

In order to run Beebop on win32 you'll need the following packages:

  * GTK+ runtime
      http://gtk-win.sourceforge.net/
  * librsvg, libcroco and libgsf
      http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/
  * libiconv
      ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/libiconv/
  * libxml2
      ftp://ftp.zlatkovic.com/libxml/

Install the GTK+ runtime first, then unpack all the other dependencies
in the same directory as the GTK+ runtime.

Be careful: the libxml2 zip contains all the needed files inside a directory
called libxml2-x.y.z.win32, so after you have unpacked it you will have to
move the files out of that directory.

As a last step, you'll have to copy bin\libxml2.dll to bin\libxml2-2.dll so
that librsvg can find it. Once you've done that, you should be able to run
Beebop.
